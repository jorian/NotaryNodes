## Story

During 2017 and 2018, HyperDEX was developed to be a Graphical User Interface for the `barterdex` Atomic Swap protocol as developed by jl777. After testing barterdex for many months, it was decided to rewrite the barterdex protocol, to what we now call `mm2.0`. Development for HyperDEX, being in Beta at the time, stalled and many months later, funding developers to make HyperDEX suitable for `mm2.0` became a problem. That's why the development of HyperDEX was put in the hands of the community, and that's why we need your help!

## Plan 2020-2021

With the funding we will get being a Notary Node, we can aim to accomplish on the short term:

- To get HyperDEX marketmaker 2.0 ready
- Ship an initial Alpha release for to allow users to test and hunt for bugs
- Fix new and existing bugs
- Do a Beta release once most of the bugs have ironed out, with support of all Komodo assets / currencies

In the long run (pending price behaviour of the crypto markets and pending any donations) the following plans for HyperDEX are:

- To develop and integrate Antara specific technologies, such as the following (in no particular order and open to community preference):
  - PricesCC - decentralized leveraged trading. Think BitMEX but decentralized
  - Stable currencies - lending of KMD and other stable assets, such as Gold, Silver or other stocks
  - AssetsCC - a place to trade tokens created on specified Komodo Smart chains
